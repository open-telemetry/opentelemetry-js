  The values for a DELTA metric are based only on the time interval
  associated with one measurement cycle. There is no dependency on
  previous measurements like is the case for CUMULATIVE metrics.

  For example, consider a system measuring the number of requests that

  DELTA metric:

  1. The system starts receiving at time=t_0.

      t_0+1 with a value of 3.

  in some form. If this state is lost or invalidated, the CUMULATIVE metric
  values MUST be reset and a new fixed start time following the last
  reported measurement time sent MUST be used.

  For example, consider a system measuring the number of requests that
  it receives and reports the sum of these requests every second as a
  CUMULATIVE metric:

  1. The system starts receiving at time=t_0.
  2. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
  3. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
  4. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.

      t_0+1 with a value of 3.
  6. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
  7. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
  8. The 1 second collection cycle ends. A metric is exported for the
      number of requests received over the interval of time t_0 to
      t_0+2 with a value of 5.
  9. The system experiences a fault and loses state.
  10. The system recovers and resumes receiving at time=t_1.
  11. A request is received, the system measures 1 request.
  12. The 1 second collection cycle ends. A metric is exported for the
      number of requests received over the interval of time t_1 to
      t_0+1 with a value of 1.

  Note: Even though, when reporting changes since last report time, using
  CUMULATIVE is valid, it is not recommended. This may cause problems for
  systems that do not use start_time to determine when the aggregation
  value was reset (e.g. Prometheus). */
