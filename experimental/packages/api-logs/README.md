# OpenTelemetry API for JavaScript

[![NPM Published Version][npm-img]][npm-url]
[![Apache License][license-image]][license-image]

This package provides everything needed to interact with the unstable OpenTelemetry Logs API, including all TypeScript interfaces, enums, and no-op implementations. It is intended for use both on the server and in the browser.

## Beta Software - Use at your own risk

The logs API is considered alpha software and there is no guarantee of stability or long-term support. When the API is stabilized, it will be made available and supported long-term in the `@opentelemetry/api` package and this package will be deprecated.

## Quick Start

Purposefully left blank until SDK is available.

## Version Compatibility

Because the npm installer and node module resolution algorithm could potentially allow two or more copies of any given package to exist within the same `node_modules` structure, the OpenTelemetry API takes advantage of a variable on the `global` object to store the global API. When an API method in the API package is called, it checks if this `global` API exists and proxies calls to it if and only if it is a compatible API version. This means if a package has a dependency on an OpenTelemetry API version which is not compatible with the API used by the end user, the package will receive a no-op implementation of the API.

## Advanced Use

### API Methods

If you are writing an instrumentation library, or prefer to call the API methods directly rather than using the `register` method on the Tracer/Meter/Logger Provider, OpenTelemetry provides direct access to the underlying API methods through the `@opentelemetry/api-logs` package. API entry points are defined as global singleton objects `trace`, `metrics`, `logs`, `propagation`, and `context` which contain methods used to initialize SDK implementations and acquire resources from the API.

- [Logs API Documentation][logs-api-docs]

```javascript
const api = require("@opentelemetry/api-logs");

/* A specific implementation of LoggerProvider comes from an SDK */
const loggerProvider = createLoggerProvider();

/* Initialize LoggerProvider */
api.logs.setGlobalLoggerProvider(loggerProvider);
/* returns loggerProvider (no-op if a working provider has not been initialized) */
api.logs.getLoggerProvider();
/* returns a logger from the registered global logger provider (no-op if a working provider has not been initialized) */
const logger = api.logs.getLogger(name, version);

// logging a log record in a log appender
logger.emit({ severityNumber: SeverityNumber.TRACE, body: 'log data' });
```
