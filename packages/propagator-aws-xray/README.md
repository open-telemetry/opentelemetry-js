# OpenTelemetry Propagator AWS X-Ray

[![NPM Published Version][npm-img]][npm-url]
[![Apache License][license-image]][license-image]

The OpenTelemetry Propagator for AWS X-Ray provides HTTP header propagation for systems that are using AWS `X-Amzn-Trace-Id` format.
This propagator translates the OpenTelemetry SpanContext into the equivalent AWS header format, for use with the OpenTelemetry JS SDK.
`TraceState` is currently not propagated.

This package was originally located in [opentelemetry-js-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js-contrib/tree/main/propagators/opentelemetry-propagator-aws-xray). It has been moved in order to make it a direct dependency of the Node SDK. As a result, versions from 1.4.0 to 1.22.0 have been skipped.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save @opentelemetry/propagator-aws-xray
```

## Usage

In the [global tracer configuration file](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/js/getting-started/nodejs/#setup), configure the following:

```js
const { NodeTracerProvider } = require('@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node');
const { AWSXRayPropagator } = require('@opentelemetry/propagator-aws-xray');
// ...

const provider = new NodeTracerProvider();

// Set the global trace context propagator to use X-Ray formatted trace header
provider.register({
  propagator: new AWSXRayPropagator()
});
```

## Propagator Details

Example header:`X-Amzn-Trace-Id: Root=1-5759e988-bd862e3fe1be46a994272793;Parent=53995c3f42cd8ad8;Sampled=1`

The header consists of three parts: the root trace ID, the parent ID and the sampling decision.

### Root - The AWS X-Ray format trace ID

- Format: (spec-version)-(timestamp)-(UUID)
  - spec_version - The version of the AWS X-Ray header format. Currently, only "1" is valid.
  - timestamp - 32-bit number in base16 format, corresponds to the first 8 characters of the OpenTelemetry trace ID. Note, while X-Ray calls this timestamp, for the purpose of propagation it is opaque and any value will work.
  - UUID - 96-bit random number in base16 format, corresponds to the last 10 characters of the OpenTelemetry trace ID.

Root is analogous to the [OpenTelemetry Trace ID](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/overview.md#spancontext), with some small format changes.
For additional reading, see the [AWS X-Ray Trace ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-api-sendingdata.html#xray-api-traceids) public documentation.

### Parent - The ID of the AWS X-Ray Segment

- 64-bit random number in base16 format. Populated from the [OpenTelemetry Span ID](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/overview.md#spancontext).

### Sampled - The sampling decision

- Defined in the AWS X-Ray specification as a tri-state field, with "0", "1" and "?" as valid values. Only "0" and "1" are used in this propagator. If "?", a new trace will be started.
- Populated from the [OpenTelemetry trace flags](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/overview.md#spancontext).
