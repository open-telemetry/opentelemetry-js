# Upgrade to OpenTelemetry JS 2.x

In late February 2025, the OpenTelemetry JavaScript project released the first versions of "JS SDK 2.x" packages. These packages include a number of breaking changes. This document shows the necessary code changes to upgrade to the new 2.x.

XXX note about "Implementation notes:" sections that can be skipped. The "Why".

XXX note to ask on #otel-js in CNCF slack or open a Discussion issue: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/issues/new?template=discussion.md

XXX perhaps TOC, of link to jump straight to the breaking changes prose below


## What is JS SDK 2.x?

"JS SDK 2.x" refers to packages from opentelemetry-js.git, except the API and semantic-conventions packages (categories 3 and 4 in the groupings below). The versions of these packages will be `>=2.0.0` for the stable and `>=0.200.0` for the unstable packages. (The jump to `0.200.x` was intentional, to hopefully help signal that these packages are in the "2.x generation".)

(TODO: Validate that it will be 0.58.0 at release time. XXX going with 0.200.0.)

XXX put this grouping into a disclosure? Perhaps yes.

The OpenTelemetry JS SIG is responsible for numerous packages -- all published to npm under the `@opentelemetry/` org, and developed in two git repositories: [opentelemetry-js.git](XXX) (sometimes called the "core" repo) and [opentelemetry-js-contrib.git](XXX) (the "contrib" repo). For the sake of this document, these packages can be grouped into these categories:

1. The [API](../api/) (`@opentelemetry/api`). The API is versioned independently of all other packages. Its version is *not* being changed as part of "JS SDK 2.x".
2. The [Semantic Conventions](../semantic-conventions/) (`@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions`). This package follows the [versioning](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/releases) of language-independent Semantic Conventions. It is *not* being changed as part of "JS SDK 2.x".
3. [Stable packages from opentelemetry-js.git](../packages/). These are packages that have reached "1.x". These packages are all versioned together, at version "1.30.0" at the time of writing.
4. [Unstable packages from opentelemetry-js.git](../experimental/packages/). These are packages deemed still experimental. They are all at "0.x" versions. These packages are all versioned together, at version "0.57.0" at the time of writing.
5. All packages from opentelemetry-js-contrib.git. These packages are all versioned independently. These packages are not considered part of the "JS SDK 2.0" release. However, eventually they will update to use JS SDK 2.0 releases.

"JS SDK 2.x" refers to categories 3 and 4.

The full set of packages is:

(TODO: List full table of "SDK 2.x" packages. The idea is to make it clear whether a given 0.x `@opentelemetry/` package applies. I'm not sure if this is useful. There *will* be upgrades to contrib packages for compat as well, so the line is blurry. Could put this in a disclosure.)


## XXX outline

- Am I ready for JS SDK 2.x?  Dropped Node 14 and 16 support. >=18.19.0.
- The highlights: min node, min TypeScript, moving away from exported *classes* because ...,
- "Why SDK 2.0?"  I.e. why should a user upgrade, other than this is what will be maintained. We don't *have* to answer this. That is more about "What's New" than covering breaking changes here.
- Statement on maint of 1.x: how long?

## XXX new changelog entries to merge

```
git ls-files | rg CHANGELOG | while read f; do echo; echo "# $f"; diff -u $f ~/src/opentelemetry-js/$f ; done
```









## ðŸ’¥ Node.js supported versions

The **minimum supported Node.js has be raised to `^18.19.0 || >=20.6.0`**. This means that support Node.js 14 and 16 has been dropped. (The particular minimum *minor* versions of Node.js 18 and 20 was selected to include support for Node.js's `--import` flag and `module.register()` API. It is expected that this will provide a smoother experience for improved automatic ES module instrumentation.)

For the time being, the minimum supported Node.js versions for `@opentelemetry/api` (Node.js v8) and `@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions` (Node.js v14) packages is not changing.

[#5395](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/issues/5395)

## TypeScript supported versions

The **minimum supported TypeScript version has been raised to 5.0.4**. As well, going forward all packages published from this repository will **drop support for old versions of `typescript` in minor releases**. We will only drop support for versions that are older than 2 years.

[#5145](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/pull/5145)


## Changes for browser users

XXX call out the `window.OTEL_*` thing. See notes in the resources section

```

```



## `@opentelemetry/resources` API changes

Perhaps the most likely API change you will need to update for is from the `@opentelemetry/resources` package.

The `Resource` *class* is no longer exported, in favor of utility functions.

- Creating a resource: `new Resource(...)` -> `resourceFromAttributes(...)`
- Getting the default resource: `Resource.default()` -> `defaultResource()`
- Getting an empty resource: `Resource.empty()` or `Resource.EMPTY` -> `emptyResource()`
- TypeScript interface for a resource: `IResource` -> `Resource`

```ts
// Before (pre-2.x)
import { Resource } from '@opentelemetry/resources';
new Resource({ ... });  // Create a resource
Resource.default();     // Get a resource with the default attributes
Resource.empty();       // Get an empty resource

// After (2.x)
import { resourceFromAttributes, defaultResource, emptyResource } from '@opentelemetry/resources';
resourceFromAttributes({ ... });
defaultResource();
emptyResource();
```

XXX ResourceAttributes -> Attributes. Needs a mention?


"Sync" and async resource detectors have been unified. Where before there were both `hostDetector` and `hostDetectorSync`, now there is only `hostDetector` which may be used in all cases.

- `envDetectorSync` -> `envDetector`
- `hostDetectorSync` -> `hostDetector`
- `osDetectorSync` -> `osDetector`
- `processDetectorSync` -> `processDetector`
- `serviceInstanceIdDetectorSync` -> `serviceInstanceIdDetector`
- `detectResourcesSync` -> `detectResources`

The `browserDetector` and `browserDetectorSync` exports were dropped. This resource detector was ago replaced by the (semantic-conventions compliant) browser detector in the separate `@opentelemetry/opentelemetry-browser-detector` package.

- `browserDetector` or `browserDetectorSync` -> `import { browserDetector } from '@opentelemetry/opentelemetry-browser-detector'`

For browser users, support for `window.OTEL_*` environment variable configuration (previous handled by the `envDetector`) has been dropped. "Environment variable" configuration for *browsers* was always an error. See [#5217](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/issues/5217) for details.

- `window.OTEL_*` usage -> use the relevant SDK APIs for configuration
- `envDetector` in a browser -> manually create a resource with the API


Implementation notes:
- In general, the OTel JS packages are tending away from exporting *classes* because that results in exporting types with internal details that inhibit later refactoring. See [XXX](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/issues/5283) for details.
- The unification of sync and async resource detectors simplified the API, clarified the behavior for merging results from multiple detectors, and laid the ground work for support OpenTelemetry Entities in the future. See [XXX](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/pull/5350) for details.

## `@opentelemetry/core` API changes

The environment variable utilities have changed to not longer have one large load and parse of all possible `OTEL_*` environment variables. Instead there are `get{Type}FromEnv()` utilities to handle the various [specified OpenTelemetry SDK environment variable types](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/#configuration-types). The caller should now handle default values.

- `getEnv().OTEL_FOO` -> `get{Type}FromEnv('OTEL_FOO') ?? defaultValue`
  - `getStringFromEnv()`
  - `getNumberFromEnv()`
  - `getBooleanFromEnv()`
  - `getStringListFromEnv()`
  - `diagLogLevelFromString()` for reading `OTEL_LOG_LEVEL`
- `getEnvWithoutDefaults().OTEL_FOO` -> `get{Type}FromEnv('OTEL_FOO')`
- The following have been removed without replacement:
  - `DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT`
  - `ENVIRONMENT`
  - `RAW_ENVIRONMENT`
  - `parseEnvironment`

For example:

```ts
// Before (pre-2.x)
import { getEnv, getEnvWithoutDefaults } from '@opentelemetry/core';
const flavor = getEnv().OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL;
const limit = getEnv().OTEL_BSP_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE;
const level = getEnv().OTEL_LOG_LEVEL;

// After (2.x)
import { getStringFromEnv } from '@opentelemetry/core';
const flavor = getStringFromEnv('OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL') ?? 'http/protobuf';
const limit = getNumberFromEnv('OTEL_BSP_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE') ?? 2048;
const level = diagLogLevelFromString(getStringFromEnv('OTEL_LOG_LEVEL'));
```

Implementation notes:
- The `getEnv()` et al API changes avoid a problem of requiring an update to
  `@opentelemetry/core` for any added `OTEL_*` envvars, including in unstable
  packages and packages maintained in the separate contrib repository.
  See [#5443](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/pull/5443).

## XXX the unstable breaking changes

XXX can merge these in with above. E.g. grouping the metrics changes.

* feat(exporter-prometheus)!: stop the using `type` field to enforce naming conventions [#5291](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/pull/5291) @chancancode
  * Any non-monotonic sums will now be treated as counters and will therefore include the `_total` suffix.
* feat(shim-opencenus)!: stop mapping removed Instrument `type` to OpenTelemetry metrics [#5291](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/pull/5291) @chancancode
  * The internal OpenTelemetry data model dropped the concept of instrument type on exported metrics, therefore mapping it is not necessary anymore.
* feat(instrumentation-fetch)!: passthrough original response to `applyCustomAttributes` hook [#5281](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/pull/5281) @chancancode
  * Previously, the fetch instrumentation code unconditionally clones every `fetch()` response in order to preserve the ability for the `applyCustomAttributes` hook to consume the response body. This is fundamentally unsound, as it forces the browser to buffer and retain the response body until it is fully received and read, which crates unnecessary memory pressure on large or long-running response streams. In extreme cases, this is effectively a memory leak and can cause the browser tab to crash. If your use case for `applyCustomAttributes` requires access to the response body, please chime in on [#5293](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/issues/5293).

* feat(sdk-node)!: use `IMetricReader` over `MetricReader` [#5311](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/pull/5311)
  * (user-facing): `NodeSDKConfiguration` now provides the more general `IMetricReader` type over `MetricReader`
