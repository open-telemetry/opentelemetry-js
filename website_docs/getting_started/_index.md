These two guides for Node.JS and the browser use simple examples in javascript to get you started with OpenTelemetry. Both will show you the following steps:

- Install the required OpenTelemetry libraries
- Initialize a global [tracer](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/api.md#tracer)
- Initialize and register a [span exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/sdk.md#span-exporter)
