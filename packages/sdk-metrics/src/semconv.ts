/**
 * A name uniquely identifying the instance of the OpenTelemetry component within its containing SDK instance.
 *
 * @example otlp_grpc_span_exporter/0
 * @example custom-name
 *
 * @note Implementations **SHOULD** ensure a low cardinality for this attribute, even across application or SDK restarts.
 * E.g. implementations **MUST NOT** use UUIDs as values for this attribute.
 *
 * Implementations **MAY** achieve these goals by following a `<otel.component.type>/<instance-counter>` pattern, e.g. `batching_span_processor/0`.
 * Hereby `otel.component.type` refers to the corresponding attribute value of the component.
 *
 * The value of `instance-counter` **MAY** be automatically assigned by the component and uniqueness within the enclosing SDK instance **MUST** be guaranteed.
 * For example, `<instance-counter>` **MAY** be implemented by using a monotonically increasing counter (starting with `0`), which is incremented every time an
 * instance of the given component type is started.
 *
 * With this implementation, for example the first Batching Span Processor would have `batching_span_processor/0`
 * as `otel.component.name`, the second one `batching_span_processor/1` and so on.
 * These values will therefore be reused in the case of an application restart.
 *
 * @experimental This attribute is experimental and is subject to breaking changes in minor releases of `@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions`.

 * When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
 * canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact **SHOULD** be used.
 *
 * Instrumentations **SHOULD** document the list of errors they report.
 *
 * The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library **SHOULD** be low.
 * Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
 * should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
 * additional filters are applied.
 *
 * If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations **SHOULD NOT** set `error.type`.
 *
 * If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or RPC status codes),
 * it's **RECOMMENDED** to:
 *
 *   - Use a domain-specific attribute
 *   - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.
