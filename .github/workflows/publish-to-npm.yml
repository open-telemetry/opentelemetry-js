        # which happens when the npm registry is not fully consistent yet. This can cause the publishing of a package to be
        # rejected because dependencies are not available yet. `lerna` does ensure that this is not the case locally
        # (packages are in-fact published in the correct order), but the race on the registry still applies.
        # If this happens, run the workflow again - there should be enough time for everything to settle until this workflow
        # attempts to publish again.
