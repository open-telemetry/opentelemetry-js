# OpenTelemetry SDK for Node.js

[![Apache License][license-image]][license-image]

**Note: This is an experimental package under active development. New releases may include breaking changes.**

This package provides the configuration for OpenTelemetry JavaScript SDK.

## Quick Start

**Note: Much of OpenTelemetry JS documentation is written assuming the compiled application is run as CommonJS.**
For more details on ECMAScript Modules vs CommonJS, refer to [esm-support](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/main/doc/esm-support.md).

To get started you need to install `@opentelemetry/configuration`.

### Installation

```sh
# Install the package
npm install @opentelemetry/configuration
```
