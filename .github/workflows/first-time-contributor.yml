            Please make sure you have read and completed the contribution checklist, which should have been used as the template when you created the PR.
            If you ever need to refer to the checklist later, it is available at [.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)


            ## Sign the Contributors Licence Agreement

            All CNCF projects require contributors to sign a CLA.
            You can sign as a company or an individual.
            All pull requests run several checks, including checking if the user who created the pull request signed the CLA.
            If you have not signed the CLA, the failed check will have a link you can follow in order to sign.
            Once you have signed, come back to this PR and comment "I signed it," and the check will be rerun.

            Once you have completed the requirements in the pull request template and the CONTRIBUTING.md file, someone from @opentelemetry/javascript-approvers will review your work.
