        Before filing a bug, please be sure you have searched through [existing open bugs](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Abug)
        to see if this bug has already been filed.

        > If you depend on experimental packages with a range like `opentelemetry/sdk-node@^0.53.0` that is equivalent
        > to `@opentelemetry/sdk-node@0.53.x`, NOT `@opentelemetry/sdk-node@0.x.x`. `0.54.x` **WILL NOT** be picked up
        > by this constraint due to the way semantic versioning works for `0.x` packages. This is intentional, see

        **How to find this information:**
          - check your `package.json`
            - if you have `"type": "commonjs"` or no `"type"` then you're likely using CommonJS
            - if you have `"type": "module"`, you are likely using ESM - please ensure you have read the [instructions for ESM users](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/main/doc/esm-support.md) before opening an issue.
          - other indicators:
            - using `.js` or `.cjs` (CommonJS)
            - using `.mjs` (ESM - please ensure you have read the [instructions for ESM users](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/main/doc/esm-support.md) before opening an issue.)

        Bundling removes `require` and `import` statements, which results in most `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-*` packages not working as they rely on the presence
        of these statements to function.

      options:
        - label: I understand that `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-*` packages are not intended to work in bundled apps (with a few exceptions).

        ## Bug Reproduction
        > [!IMPORTANT]
        >  **If you use a third-party package that re-distributes OpenTelemetry, open the bug ticket with that third party unless you can provide steps to reproduce this with pure OpenTelemetry.**
        >  Digging into third-party distributions of OpenTelemetry is not in scope for this project.

        ## Steps to Reproduce
          <!--
            Please consider providing a link to a reproducer repository. It is extremely difficult to exactly reproduce problems
            and doing so can take multiple hours for us. By providing a reproducer you indirectly contribute back to the project
            and ensure we can get working on fixing your bug as soon as possible instead of spending precious time asking
            questions and checking responses. You know your tooling and setup and we know OpenTelemetry JavaScript internals.
            Let's help each other! :)
         -->
        ## Expected Result

        ## Actual Result

        ## Additional Details
         <!--
           Anything you can think of that will help us reproduce and understad your problem:
              - details about the behavior of the bug
              - code to reproduce, if not provided via a repository above (including setting up any frameworks you may be using, we likely don't use the same tech-stack that you're using on the daily)
              - which tooling you use and how you're using it
              - config files for your tooling (typescript, bundlers, ...)
              - how you run your code (example: `node -r otel.js ./index.js`).
         -->
